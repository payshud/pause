<h1>The Model</h1>
<h2>Welcome to the Model Page!</h2>
<p>Master Certified Coach Brooke Castillo created the Model to use in her own life… and it was so good, she had to share. Now thousands of people have used the Model to get extraordinary results.</p>
<p>The basic premise of the Model is that your thoughts produce your feelings, your feelings fuel your actions, and your actions create your results.</p>
<p>You can fill the model out in any order!</p>
<p>For a more indepth explaination, look under the model boxes.</p>

<h1>The Circumstance</h1>

<p>Circumstances are facts that can be proven in a court of law. It must be measurable, provable, and not debatable.This is how circumstances work. They’re always facts that everyone agrees on and can be proven.</p>

<p>Besides basic facts, there are two additional components to circumstances: your past and other people’s actions. The events of your past are circumstances.Circumstances—the facts of your life—are neutral. That means they’re neither good nor bad. Circumstances only become good or bad based on the thoughts we have about them.</p>

<h1>The Thoughts</h1>

<p>Thoughts are sentences in your head. It is your opinion. Many people could have different opinions about the same circumstance.You know a thought is a thought and not a circumstance if there are any descriptive words or opinions in the sentence around the facts. Even if 100 people out of 100 agree on something that has an opinion in it, it’s still a thought because it can’t be proven as a fact. The number of people agreeing with a thought doesn’t make it a circumstance. It’s still a thought.</p>

<p>Any time you add a qualifier to a circumstance, you are choosing to think a thought. As human beings, we have approximately 60,000 thoughts per day. Most people have unsupervised minds, meaning they don’t intentionally choose their thoughts. That is what gets them into big trouble; they feel so bad on a regular basis without knowing why or how to process their emotions.</p>

<p>Nothing that happens in your life is amazing or terrible until you decide to have a thought about it.If you haven’t trained your brain to think intentionally, you will continue to repeat your past and have the same thoughts you’ve always had. You have to train your brain to create new results for your future. This is what you can do with the Model.</p>

<h1>The Feelings</h1>
<p>Feelings are vibrations in your body.We’re not taught how to feel. Because of the way our brains have developed to avoid pain, we typically avoid, resist, and react to negative emotions. We need to learn how to notice, acknowledge, and name our feelings and experience them as vibrations in our body.</p>

<p>When using the Model, feelings should be described in one word. Examples of feelings that can be expressed in one word are happy, sad, angry, ashamed, determined, joyful, uncertain, and depressed. Many people confuse thoughts and feelings.No one can cause you to feel a certain way. Your thoughts about what someone did (or didn’t do) are what cause you to feel something.</p>

<p>Your thoughts cause your emotions—always.</p>

<p>This is great news, because it means you can choose how you want to think and, therefore, how you want to feel.

That doesn’t mean you’ll feel good all the time. In fact, you’ll feel bad about 50% of the time. But you’ll feel bad because you’re choosing to feel bad, not because someone else is making you feel bad.

When you say someone else makes you feel a certain way, you give your power away. And in most cases, other people are notoriously bad at making us feel the way we want to feel. That is another reason to be thankful that you alone are responsible for how you feel.</p>

<h1>The Action</h1>

<p>Actions are what you do, don’t do, or react to (i.e., actions, inactions, and reactions). In the Model, your feelings fuel your actions, inactions, and reactions. Your actions, inactions, and reactions will be based on the feeling that fueled them. If you’re not taking action and wondering why, ask yourself what the feeling is that you’re having right before you want to take action. Then, work backward to determine what thought is driving the feeling.</p>

<h1>The Result</h1>

<p>Results are the consequences or outcomes of your actions, inactions, or reactions.The problem with most coaching is that it focuses solely on changing your actions. When you change your actions and don’t change the thoughts and feelings behind the actions, there’s resistance, which makes it difficult—if not impossible—to see real change. That is treating the symptom instead of the root cause of the problem.</p>
