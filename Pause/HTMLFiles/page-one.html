  <p> Hi my name is Aspen Kieckhefer. I am one of the three creators of Pause. I am 15 years old. I wanted to create this website to give people a free organized and calm way to use and find mental health resources.I am a boy girl twin and my younger siblings are boy girl twins.  I have two pugs named Santino and Vinny. I love music, swimming and Koding. I also like cooking with my mom when I get to. I am from Nevada and especially during the covid pandemic mental health is and was very important. Lots of people are not only struggling with their mental health and having a hard time but people who didn’t struggle with mental health before are now and so we are hoping that this website helps people build tools and have resources to help themselves with mental health. I am so excited to bring this to life and hope you all love it.</p>

  <p> Hello my name is Makaylah Garcia. Aspen, Paysen, and myself are the creators of Pause. A free app that aids to help its users deal and focus on improving their mental health. We are no experts in psychology or neurology. Therefore we have embedded many reliable, safe resources in our website. I am 17 years old and a freshman in college. I am majoring in computer science and would like to pursue a career in coding. This is my first program and I am ecstatic with the results. Thanks for visiting our application!</p>

  <p>Hi, my name is Paysen Hudson! I am 17 years old, a senior in high school, and a sophomore in college. I am getting an associates degree in computer science and I hope to go into a technology career! My partners and I decided to make this website because we felt as if there were little resources for teenagers to help them with their mental health. Any app or website seems to require money and we want to allow teenagers a way to only need to invest time instead of money. We believe mental health is important and there should be an easily accessible way to get information. We are not medical professionals, so this website is a collection of professional resources to give it’s users an easy path to learning their mind!</p>
